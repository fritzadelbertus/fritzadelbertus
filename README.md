## About Me
Greetings! I'm Fritz Adelbertus Sitindaon, a 19 years old college freshman majoring Mathematics. I have a genuine interest in math, computer science, informatics, and art.

I'm a 0$ Front-End Web Developer and I haven't spent a single penny in my journey to learn Web Development. I spend my time creating projects, attending free courses, and reading documentations.

I started this journey in June 2022. Currently I am learning TypeScript and React JS Framework by creating web projects related to my major in mathematics. My goal in this first year of learning web dev is to gain new experiences in the field of Web Development.
